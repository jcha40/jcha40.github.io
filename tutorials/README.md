# Python tutorials
These python tutorials are in the form of jupyter notebooks. You can view them on github, but to run them you will need to install jupyter. The easiest way to do this is to follow the instructions at https://jupyter.org/install.

Alternatively, you could upload them to google drive and open them in google colab. To do this, open google drive, click on the new button, select more, and then select connect more apps. Search for colab, and then click on the connect button. You can then open the notebooks in colab by right clicking on them and selecting open with colab.
